# DevLog Maintenance

After completing any ticket or significant work unit, update `docs/tickets/devlog.md`:

1. Change the ticket status emoji (⬜→🔵→🟢)
2. Fill in all sections of the entry template (summary, metadata, scope, achievements, etc.)
3. Update the "Running Totals" table at the bottom
4. Include actual time spent vs estimate
5. List every file created and modified
6. Document any issues encountered and how they were solved
7. Note key learnings and takeaways

Rules:
- Be specific — include commit hashes, branch names, exact file counts
- Be honest about time variance — over-estimates are as useful as under-estimates
- Document what DIDN'T work, not just what did
- Keep the next ticket's planned scope accurate as understanding evolves
- The devlog is the project's memory — future sessions start by reading it
